Move block with arrows or WASD

Rotate 3-letter blocks with PageUp/PageDown or Q/E. 2-letter blocks can't be rotated.

Red letters indicate there's some other letter below them and if it's dropped there you loose.

You gain more points for longer words and creating multiple words in one drop. And a bonus each time you clear the board when it has had leftover letters.

Higher levels give more points but  make blocks drop faster.

You can pause with P / Pause.

You can restart by holding R for one second.

If you want to give up but want the score, simply drop the block ontop of some existing letters."
